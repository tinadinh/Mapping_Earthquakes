# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to gather earthquake GeoJSON data from the USGS API for the past seven days, and also to create and explore interactive maps of earthquakes around the world. The earthquake data is represented on the maps in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and according to each event's magnitude specificially, all earthquakes with a greater magnitude than 4.5.

### Resources
- Data Source: Earthquakes GeoJSON, Earthquakes above 4.5mag GeoJSON, Tectonic Plate GeoJSON
- Software: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code 1.64.2, Leaflet 1.7.1, D3.js 7.3.0

## Results
You can choose to toggle the earthquake and tectonic plate data, and also the map view from three different views:
